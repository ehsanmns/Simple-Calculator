<h1><strong>Python Basic Calculator</strong></h1>
<p>This is a simple command-line calculator built in Python. It can perform four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program is designed to follow best practices for writing maintainable and readable code.</p>
<h3><strong>Installation</strong></h3>
<p>1-Clone the repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/ehsanmns/python-basic-calculator.git<br />2-Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository<br />3-Run the program using the command python calculator.py<br />Usage<br />When you run the program, you will be prompted to select an operation by entering a number from 1 to 4:</p>
<p>1-Addition<br />2-Subtraction<br />3-Multiplication<br />4-Division</p>
<p>After selecting an operation, you will be asked to enter two numbers to perform the operation on. If you choose division, the program will check for division by zero and handle the error appropriately.</p>
<p>The result of the operation will be displayed in the console.</p>
<p><strong>Functions</strong></p>
<p>The program defines four functions for performing arithmetic operations:</p>
<p>. add(x: float, y: float) -&gt; float: Returns the sum of two numbers.<br />. subtract(x: float, y: float) -&gt; float: Returns the difference between two numbers.<br />. multiply(x: float, y: float) -&gt; float: Returns the product of two numbers.<br />. divide(x: float, y: float) -&gt; float: Returns the quotient of two numbers. Raises a ZeroDivisionError if the denominator is zero.</p>
<p>Each function has a clear docstring that explains what it does and what it returns.</p>
<h3><strong>Error Handling</strong></h3>
<p>The program handles possible errors in input by checking whether the user entered valid numbers. If the input is not valid, the program prompts the user to enter a valid number.</p>
<p>In addition, the divide function checks for division by zero and raises a ZeroDivisionError if the denominator is zero.</p>
